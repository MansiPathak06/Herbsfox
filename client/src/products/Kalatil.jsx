                    <h4>History of Kala Til:</h4>
                    Kala Til has a long history that dates back thousands of
                    years. Originating from India, black sesame seeds have been
                    used both for culinary and medicinal purposes. Ancient
                    Ayurvedic texts mention the therapeutic properties of Kala
                    Til, highlighting its ability to nourish the body and
                    promote overall well-being.
                    <br />
                    Throughout history, Kala Til has held a significant place in
                    many cultures. In Chinese tradition, these seeds were
                    believed to promote healthy hair growth and slow down the
                    aging process. Similarly, in Indian folklore, black sesame
                    seeds were considered a symbol of immortality and were often
                    included in auspicious ceremonies.

                    <h4>Health Benefits of Kala Til :</h4>
                    1. Nutritional Powerhouse: Kala Til is a rich source of
                    essential nutrients, including protein, fiber, vitamin B6,
                    iron, magnesium, and calcium. Consuming these seeds
                    regularly can help meet daily nutrient requirements and
                    support overall health.
                    <br />
                    2. Heart Health: The high content of monounsaturated and
                    polyunsaturated fats in Kala Til helps maintain healthy
                    cholesterol levels and reduces the risk of heart diseases.
                    Additionally, the presence of sesamin and sesamol compounds
                    in these seeds act as antioxidants, protecting the heart
                    from oxidative stress.
                    <br />
                    3. Bone Health: Kala Til is a great source of calcium,
                    magnesium, and phosphorus, which are essential minerals for
                    maintaining strong and healthy bones. Regular consumption of
                    black sesame seeds can help prevent osteoporosis and other
                    bone-related disorders.
                    <br />
                    4. Digestive Health: The fiber content in Kala Til promotes
                    healthy digestion and regulates bowel movements. It helps
                    prevent constipation and promotes the growth of beneficial
                    gut bacteria, supporting overall gut health.
                    <br />
                    5. Skin and Hair Health: Black sesame seeds are known for
                    their remarkable impact on skin and hair health. They are
                    rich in antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress and
                    slow down the aging process. Regular consumption of Kala Til
                    can improve skin elasticity, reduce fine lines and wrinkles,
                    and promote healthy hair growth.

                    <h4>Usage of Kala Til :</h4>
                    Kala Til can be used in a variety of ways and incorporated
                    into your daily diet. Here are a few popular ways to use
                    black sesame seeds:
                    <br />
                    1. Cooking: Black sesame seeds are commonly used as a
                    topping for various dishes, including salads, stir-fries,
                    and sushi. They add a nutty flavor and a subtle crunch to
                    your meals.
                    <br />
                    2. Baking: You can use Kala Til in baking recipes to enhance
                    both the flavor and appearance of baked goods. Black sesame
                    seeds can be sprinkled on bread, cookies, or cakes before
                    baking to add a unique twist.
                    <br />
                    3. Sesame Oil: Another popular usage of Kala Til is in the
                    form of cold-pressed sesame oil, which is used in cooking
                    and as a dressing for salads. This oil has a distinct nutty
                    flavor and can add depth to your dishes.
                    <br />
                    4. Tahini: Tahini, a creamy paste made from ground sesame
                    seeds, is a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine. It is used as
                    a base for dips like hummus or as a flavoring in sauces and
                    dressings.
                    <br />
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Side Effects of Kala Til:</h4>
                    While Kala Til is generally safe for consumption, certain
                    individuals may experience allergic reactions to sesame
                    seeds. Allergy symptoms may include hives, itching, swelling
                    of the face or throat, difficulty breathing, and digestive
                    issues. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional
                    if you experience any adverse reactions after consuming Kala
                    Til.
                    <br />
                    Additionally, individuals with certain medical conditions,
                    such as kidney stones or gallstones, should exercise caution
                    when consuming black sesame seeds due to their higher
                    oxalate content.

                    <h4>Health Benefits of Shital Chini:</h4>
                    1. Cooling Properties: Shital Chini is highly regarded for
                    its cooling effect on the body, making it a popular choice
                    during hot summer months or to alleviate conditions like
                    heat stroke or fever. It helps to regulate body temperature
                    and provides relief from excessive heat.
                    <br />
                    2. Digestive Aid: This herb is known for its carminative
                    properties, which means it aids in digestion by preventing
                    gas formation and bloating. It also stimulates the
                    production of digestive enzymes, promoting a healthy
                    digestive system.
                    <br />
                    3. Respiratory Health: If you are suffering from respiratory
                    issues like asthma, bronchitis, or a common cold, Shital
                    Chini can provide relief. Its expectorant properties help to
                    loosen mucus, making it easier to expel from the body.
                    <br />
                    4. Anti-inflammatory Agent: Shital Chini possesses powerful
                    anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to alleviate
                    various conditions like arthritis, joint pain, and muscle
                    inflammation. Regular consumption can reduce swelling and
                    pain associated with inflammatory diseases.
                    <br />
                    5. Antimicrobial Properties: Shital Chini contains compounds
                    that have antimicrobial properties, helping to fight against
                    bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It can be used as a natural
                    remedy for various infections, including urinary tract
                    infections, skin infections, and respiratory infections.
                    <br />
                    6. Oral Health: With its antimicrobial properties, Shital
                    Chini helps combat oral bacteria responsible for gum
                    diseases, tooth decay, and bad breath. Using it as a mouth
                    rinse or adding it to toothpaste can promote good oral
                    hygiene.

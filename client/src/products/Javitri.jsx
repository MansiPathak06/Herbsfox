                    compounds that offer numerous health benefits. Letâ€™s take a
                    closer look at some of these benefits:
                    <br />
                    1. Boosts Digestive Health: Javitri has carminative
                    properties, which means it helps in relieving digestive
                    issues like bloating, gas, and indigestion. It also aids in
                    improving appetite and promotes proper digestion.
                    <br />
                    2. Improves Oral Health: Javitri oil is commonly used in
                    dental care products as it has antibacterial properties. It
                    helps in eliminating oral bacteria, preventing tooth decay,
                    gum infections, and bad breath.
                    <br />
                    3. Enhances Brain Function: Javitri contains myristicin and
                    macelignan, two compounds known for their neuroprotective
                    properties. These compounds help in improving cognitive
                    function, memory, and concentration.
                    <br />
                    4. Supports Heart Health: Javitri possesses antioxidant
                    properties, which help in reducing oxidative stress in the
                    body. It also helps in regulating blood pressure and
                    cholesterol levels, thus promoting heart health.
                    <br />
                    5. Anti-inflammatory Properties: The essential oil extracted
                    from javitri has anti-inflammatory properties. It can be
                    used topically to reduce swelling, pain, and inflammation
                    associated with conditions like arthritis and muscle
                    soreness.

                    used whole in pickles and spice blends.
                    <br />
                    2. Infused Oil: Javitri oil can be prepared by steeping the
                    dried javitri in a carrier oil like coconut or sesame oil.

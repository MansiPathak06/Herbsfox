                    <h4>What is Dry Amla?</h4>
                    It is a versatile fruit that can be pickled into Amla
                    murabba or strained as Amla juice. However, dry Amla is one
                    of the most antioxidant-rich foods on earth. Amla dry fruit
                    works brilliantly for most parts of the body, commonly used
                    in several Ayurvedic and herbal preparations.
                    <br />
                    One Amla is equal to how many apples?
                    <br />
                    One Amla is equal to 10 apples. This comes as no surprise,
                    seeing the Indian gooseberryâ€™s benefits and use in Ayurvedic
                    medicines.
                    <br />
                    It is dried to be preserved for several years and consumed
                    daily for maximum health benefits.
                    <br />
                    Dried gooseberry is obtained by drying fresh amla fruits.
                    Clean the Indian gooseberry and sun-dry them on a thick
                    cotton cloth. The drying process removes all the water, and
                    Amlaâ€™s nutrients get fully concentrated. It may take 6-8
                    days to be dried and crisp. The dried part contains all the
                    concentrations of nutrients present in it.
                    <br />
                    How many Amla to eat in a day?
                    <br />
                    The recommended intake is about 1-2 Amla daily. You can
                    consume this quantity in different forms.
